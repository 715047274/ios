## Dependencies

### SDK

* https://github.com/tidwall/SwiftWebSocket for websocket support

### Application

* https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift for local persistence
* https://github.com/jrendel/SwiftKeychainWrapper
* [GoogleService-Info.plist](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client) for push notifications. See below.


## Push notifications

If you want to use the app with your own server and want push notification to work you have to set them up:

* Register at https://firebase.google.com/, [set up the project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) if you have not done so already.
* [Download your own](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client) config file `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it to the `Tinodios/` folder of your copy of the project. The config file contains keys specific to your Firebase/FCM registration. The project will not compile without the `GoogleService-Info.plist`.
* Copy Google-provided server key to `tinode.conf`, see details [here](https://github.com/tinode/chat/blob/master/docs/faq.md#q-how-to-setup-fcm-push-notifications).
